Changes are noted throughout the documentation, and you can also read [this commit in our docs repo](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/commit/545ff4a7883e5eee7ee91d19a5e5d760a0730033) for a full diff.\nThe changes are:\n- API and Gateway v8 are now available. v6 is still the default for the time being.\n- [Gateway Intents](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents) are now required\n- Removed `guild_subscriptions` in identify in favor of [Gateway Intents](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents).\n- All permissions have been converted to strings-serialized numbers. As such, `permissions_new`, `allow_new`, and `deny_new` have been removed\n- The `game` field has been removed. If you need a direct replacement, you can instead reference the first element of `activities`\n- Channel Permission Overwrite `type`s are now numbers (0 and 1) instead of strings (\"role\" and \"member\"). However due to a current technical constraint, they are string-serialized numbers in audit log `options`.\n- `embed_enabled` and `embed_channel_id` have been removed. Use `widget_enabled` and `widget_channel_id` instead.\n- Form body errors have been improved to include more helpful messaging on validation. [See more here](#DOCS_REFERENCE/error-messages)\n- The `Retry-After` header value and `retry_after` body value is now based in seconds instead of milliseconds (e.g. `123` means 123 seconds)\n- The `X-RateLimit-Precision` header is no longer respected. `X-RateLimit-Reset` and `X-RateLimit-Reset-After` are always returned at millisecond precision (e.g. `123.456` instead of `124`)\n- Bots no longer receive [Channel Create Gateway Event](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-create) for DMs\n- `delete-message-days` is no longer available. Use `delete_message_days`.\n- Removed `roles`, `premium_since`, and `nick` from [Presence Update Gateway Event](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update)\n- Removed some [integration object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/integration-object) fields for Discord application integrations\n- Removed `include_applications` from [Get Guild Integrations](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/get-guild-integrations). Application integrations are always included.\n- The following deprecated routes have been removed for better naming conventions:\nRemoved in favor of `/guilds/<guild_id>/widget`:\n- `/guilds/<guild_id>/embed`\nRemoved in favor of `/guilds/<guild_id>/widget.json`:\n- `/servers/<guild_id>/embed.json`\n- `/servers/<guild_id>/widget.json`\n- `/guilds/<guild_id>/embed.json`\nRemoved in favor of `/guilds/<guild_id>/widget.png`:\n- `/guilds/<guild_id>/embed.png`\nRemoved in favor of `/channels/<channel_id>/messages/bulk-delete`:\n- `/channels/<channel_id>/messages/bulk_delete/`\nRemoved in favor of `/invites/<code>/`:\n- `/invite/<code>/`"

The \"default\" channel for a given user is now the channel with the highest position that their permissions allow them to see. New guilds will no longer have a default channel with the same id as the guild. Existing guilds will not have their #general channel id changed. It is possible, if permissions are set in such a way, that a user will not have a default channel in a guild.\nWe saw a use case in many servers where the previously-default #general channel was being repurposed as an announcement-only, non-writable channel for new members by using bots to clear the entire message history. Now, that channel can simply be deleted and re-created with the desired permissions. This change also allows dynamic default channels for users based on permissions.\nWe are also rolling out a change in conjunction that will allow Discord to remember your last-visited channel in a guild across sessions. Newly-joined users will be directed to the guild's default channel on first join; existing members will return to whichever channel they last visited."

In addition, Developer must implement the Discord Store SDK in a manner that is safe and secure for the Discord Store Account Owner.  Discord may, but shall not be obligated to, correct any security vulnerabilities in Developer’s implementation of the Discord Store SDK and Developer shall provide assistance with such corrections as requested by Discord.  If Discord cannot reasonably correct any such vulnerabilities, or Discord determines that Developer should correct them, Developer shall correct such vulnerabilities.\n5.2 **Developer Support to End Users.** Developer will provide support to Discord Store Account Owners who have acquired a copy of the Apps, at the same level that Developer provides customer support for such applications made available directly or via other channels.

Also, to the extent that the payment calculation in a Monthly Report results in a negative amount, that negative amount will be carried forward and deducted from any future amounts otherwise payable to Developer by Discord under this Agreement.\n6.4 **Multi-Platform Apps.** To the extent that Developer has submitted to Discord Store versions of an App for multiple operating systems (for example, a Mac version, and a Windows version) such versions shall be sold together as a single \"hybrid\" App unit on Discord Store. Accordingly, a Mac version of any App, a Windows version of an App, and a Linux version of an App shall not be considered separate sales when calculating the payments due to Developer hereunder."

Exclude certain files from being uploaded\n`mappings` lets you tell Dispatch to download files to a certain place in the install directory on a user's machine, letting you create the folder structure you need. Your game build files may be tucked deep in a subdirectory on your machine, because who ever cleans up folder structures, but you can make sure it looks nice and clean for your players.\n`properties` allows you to mark properties on globs of files. In this case, marking a glob of files as `user_data` tells Dispatch not to touch these files in any way if it sees them; don't want that save data overwritten!\n`exclusions` also allow you to mark off globs of files.

They can now explore the new area.\nHowever, some games do rely on downloading additional files for DLC content. If that is the case with your game, let's see how Dispatch can help.

Or, really, without them even needing to know there _was_ a patch! Your players will automatically download your latest and greatest stuff, and quickly!\nIf you have your own patcher and do not want Discord to handle patching, set `\"should_patch\": false` in the application configuration.

Very touchy subject.\nIn light of those learnings, we built Dispatch! Great name, isn't it? _Dis_-patch? Anyway, Dispatch is your all-in-one uploader tool to get your builds, artwork, patches, DLC, and anything else onto Discord's servers. It's fast, easy to use, and I've been assured by our engineers that it's made of 100% farm-raised, cage-free, grass-fed code.\nIf you are looking to update your store page, head on over to our handy dandy [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers). It has all the tools you need to make changes to your store page for your game. To view your store page either make a store channel in the server you selected for your application and choose the SKU that you made the store page for or you can just hit the view store page button in the discord developer portal.\nLet's get you pointed in the right direction; follow this little Table of Contents to start, and you'll be a pro with this tool faster than you can say \"But wait I don't actually know what a terminal is.\"\n1.

Within your hordes of adoring fans lies your Trusted Testing Group (tm), the best of the best when it comes to feedback. Maybe you want to give them access to a special `insider-only-private-beta` branch of your game. You can, with role-based entitlement!\nStore channels in Discord are just like any other channel in that they can have a set of permissions applied to them. What is special about them is that if they are set as a Beta branch, entitlement to that branch is tied to having permissions to view the channel. So, all your testers with a `Beta Tester` role, for example, will be able to get entitlement to the `insider-only-private-beta` branch. And, if they are later removed from that role, entitlement from that branch will be removed.\nA scenario might look like this: you create a Beta store channel. Only users with role `Awesome Tester` can view it. Player A is an `Awesome Tester`. They can view the channel and get entitlement to the beta branch. Player A becomes inactive; you remove them from the `Awesome Tester` role. Player A loses entitlement to `insider-only-private-beta`"

That means that you can create codes for your game to give to everyone, but they won't be able to play until the `VALID FROM` date. Similarly, you can set a `VALID UNTIL` date on all your gift codes if you want the entitlements to expire after a certain time, removing access from players.\nNote that the `VALID UNTIL` date will not remove the game from the user's library, but they will no longer be able to launch it.\nUp to 25,000 gift codes can be created at a time. When you go to create gift codes, you'll notice there are a few fields for you to fill out. Here's what they mean:\n![Screenshot of the modal to create gift codes with on the developer dashboard](gift-code-creation.png)\n- SKU: the SKU that you want the user to get\n- Branch: the branch of your game you want the user to get\n- Valid From: the start date at which the entitlement is valid\n- Valid Until: the date at which the entitlement is no longer valid\n- Amount: the number of codes you want to create (up to 25,000 per batch)\n- Description: a short description of why you made the codes, so you remember!\nOnce you've made your codes, you can download the `.csv` that has them all in it, and distribute them however you'd like!"

This should be the app you created when you started; it's the one linked to your server. After selecting your app, you'll be prompted to select a SKU. What's a SKU? A SKU is simply a thing that a user can buy. This is most likely your game (a SKU of type `Game`), but could also be `IAP`, `DLC`, or a `Bundle`.\nYou can create SKUs to put up for sale by going to your app and selecting `SKU Management`.\n![Screenshot of the SKU Management dashboard](sku-management.png)\nOnce you select your SKU and create your channel...it's there! You now have a store channel in your server! If you want, you can set permissions on this channel like any channel in a server to restrict who can see it. Learn more about that by reading [Alpha and Beta Testing](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_ALPHA_AND_BETA_TESTING/)."

Show your players just how successful they are.\nAchievements are managed in the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Head over to your application --> `Achievements` to create and manage achievements for your game. You'll give them an icon, a name, and a description; then they'll be assigned an id.\nYou can also mark achievements as `secret` and `secure`. \"Secret\" achievements will _not_ be shown to the user until they've unlocked them. \"Secure\" achievements can only be set via HTTP calls from your server, _not_ by a game client using the SDK. No cheaters here!"

Check out our [OAuth2 documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) for more information.\nThese bearer tokens are good for seven days, after which they will expire. When a user reconnects to your game, and is online and connected to the internet, they'll receive a new token that you can grab.\nThis manager also includes a couple useful helper functions, like getting the locale in which the user has chosen to use their Discord client, and knowing which game branch the game is running on.

For example, `RelationshipManager` has a function called `Filter()`, which lets you pare down a user's inter-Discord relationships based on a boolean condition, like being friends!"

Anyway.\nIf you want people playing your game to be able to talk with each other, this Voice manager can help you out! Note that the main functionality for voice in this SDK is not _only_ in this manager. Connecting players to a voice chat happens with [ConnectVoice](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_LOBBIES/connectvoice) in the Lobby manager, and robust voice settings work through [OpenVoiceSettings](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_OVERLAY/openvoicesettings) in the Overlay manager. The Voice manager handles a few fine-grain details like self muting/deafening, swapping between VAD/PTT voice modes, and setting a PTT key. It's a subset of the robust settings from the overlay call for those of you that prefer to build UI and control things from your own game."

This manager works hand in hand with the networking layer of our SDK to make multiplayer integrations a breeze by:\n- Creating, managing, and joining lobbies\n- Matchmaking users based on lobby metadata, like ELO\n- Getting and setting arbitrary metadata on lobbies and lobby members\nLobbies in Discord work in one of two ways. By using calls from the SDK, lobbies are effectively \"owned\" by the user who's client creates the lobby. Someone boots up the game, hits your \"Create Lobby\" button, and their game client calls `LobbyManager.CreateLobby()` from the Discord SDK.\nThere is also another way to create and \"own\" lobbies with which the source of truth can be your own server. These SDK functions calls map to API endpoints that are exposed in Discord's HTTP API. In lieu of creating and managing lobbies in the SDK, you can call those endpoints directly with a token for your application and take care of it all on some far-away, totally secure server. Let's go over the SDK first."

Lobbies in Discord are even more useful when hooked together with Activities/Rich Presence functionality; they give you everything you need to create an awesome game invite system.\nIf you are creating lobbies for users in the game client, and not on a backend server, consider using `GetLobbyActivitySecret` and `ConnectWithActivitySecret()`. `GetLobbyActivitySecret()` will return you a unique secret for the lobby concatenated with the lobby's id. You can pipe this value directly to the `Secrets.Join` field of the `Activity` payload. Then, when a user receives the secret, their client can call `ConnectWithActivitySecret()` with just the secret; the lobby id is parsed out automatically. This saves you the effort of concatenating the secret + id together yourself and then parsing them out again. As a code example:"

Because the DLL that you ship with your game is a stub that calls out to the local Discord client for actual operations, the SDK does not necessarily care if the game was launched from Discord. As long as the player launching the game:\n1.  Has Discord installed\n2.  Has a Discord account\n3.  Has logged into Discord on their machine (whether or not Discord is open)\nThe SDK will function as if the game were launched from Discord and everything will work; if Discord is not currently launched, the SDK will launch it.\nThat means that if Player A is launching Your Amazing Game from Discord, and Player B is launching it from Other Cool But Not As Cool As Discord Game Store, as long as Player B meets the above criteria, both players can play with each other using Discord's lobbies + networking functions. If the SDK is not able to launch Discord for Player B—maybe they've never installed/used Discord before!—you'll get an error saying as much. We're not saying what you _should_ do, but hey, wouldn't this make a really neat in-game touchpoint for your players to join their friends on Discord, and maybe even join your game's [verified server](https://discord.com/verification)?\nOK so this wasn't really a code example, but I think you get how this works."

What that means is that using the network manager directly affords you the flexibility to update routes, open channels, and handle events directly emitted by the SDK. If you're looking for something a bit easier and faster to integrate, we recommend that you check out the networking wrapper around our lobby documentation: [Integrated Networking](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_LOBBIES/integrated-networking)\nNeed a networking layer? Have a networking layer! This manager handles all things packets so you can get data from player to player and make your multiplayer...work. It:\n- Functions as a connection-oriented, TCP-like API, but over UDP!\n- Supports \"reliable\" and \"unreliable\" connections\n  - Packets with loot in them always get there, but player positioning can be eventually consistent\n- Features P2P-like connections, but routed through Discord's high-end server infrastructure\n  - All the benefits of direct connections, without the IP leaks!\n- Is encrypted!\nAn important note to make here is that our networking layer **is not peer-to-peer**. Discord has always promised that we will not leak your IP, and we promise to keep it that way. Though it seems like you are connected directly to another user, it routes through Discord's servers in the middle, ensuring both security and robust networking thanks to our servers."

For this reason, you should call it at the beginning of your game loop; that way, any new data is handled immediately by callbacks you've registered. In Unity, for example, this goes in `Update()`.\n`Flush()` is specific to the network manager. It actually _writes_ the packets out to the stream. You should call this at the _end_ of your game loop as a way of saying \"OK, I'm done with networking stuff, go send all the stuff to people who need it\". In Unity, for example, this goes in `LateUpdate()`."

This route will change, most commonly if the user's external IP address changes. As that route changes, the player will receive `OnRouteUpdate` events. They should then alert other lobby members that their route has changed by updating their lobbymetadata. Other lobby members will see those updates from the `OnLobbyMemberUpdate` event, and can call `UpdateRoute()` accordingly. A user's route could change frequently, so architect your system anticipating frequent route changes and updates.\nOnce Player A has a route open to Player B, Player A then opens a channel to Player B, and Player B does the same to Player A. Channels are the pipes down which data is actually sent. These two users can now send data back and forth to each other with `SendMessage()` and receive it with `OnMessage`.\nIn order to properly send and receive data between A and B, both users need to have **the same type of channel** open to each other **on the same channel number**. If A has Reliable Channel 4 open to B, B also needs Reliable Channel 4 open to A."

Therefore, there are some important factors to remember when working with this manager. When you are first getting a list of a user's relationships, before you can `Filter()`, you need to wait for the `OnRefresh` callback to fire. This is your indicator that Discord has successfully taken a snapshot of the state of all your relationships at a given moment. Now that you have this snapshot, you can `Filter()` it to build the list that you want, and then iterate over that list to do whatever your game needs to do. Use this to build your initial social graph for a user.\nAs relationships change, the `OnRelationshipUpdate` event will fire. You can use this to update the user's social graph, changing the status of the other Discord users that you chose to filter, e.g. someone is now online, or now playing the game, or no longer playing.\nAn example of how to do this properly is at the end of this documentation page."

Here it is:\n- [Discord Game SDK](https://dl-game-sdk.discordapp.net/2.5.6/discord_game_sdk.zip)\nThere's a few things in there, but let's quickly talk about what the SDK actually _is_. Inside the `lib/` folder, you'll see `x86/` and `x86_64/` that have some `.lib`, `.bundle`, and `.dll` files. These are the things you want to distribute with your game.\nThese files are comprised of two parts: a \"stub\", and fallback modules. What that means is that when everything is running smoothly, the DLLs will just call back to the local running Discord client to do the heavy lifting. If, however, something is wrong, like a breaking change, the files also include \"fallback\" modules that reflect the native SDK modules in Discord at the time that version of the SDK was published. TLDR - you don't need to worry about breaking changes."

These are our source files, including headers and `.cpp` file, that we'll need to reference in our build script. Second is the contents of the `lib/` folder. In this walkthrough we'll assume that we only care about win64, for ease of use.\nFirst, you'll want to copy the header files and `.cpp` files to a folder somewhere in your project directory. For ease of a quickstart example, you can put them right inside your `Source/your-project-name` folder; I'd put them in a containing folder called something like `discord-files/`.\nSecond, you'll want to copy the `.dll` and `.lib` files from the `lib/x86_64` folder of the downloaded zip. These files should be put in `your-project-name/Binaries/Win64/`. For win32, take the files from `x86/` and put them, in `your-project-name/Binaries/Win32`.\nNext, we need to link these files within our project so that we can reference them. If you open up your project's `.sln` file in Visual Studio, you'll find a file called `your-project-name.Build.cs`. We're going to add the following lines of code to that file:"

So, we've got a solution for you! By using system environment variables, you can tell the SDK in a certain game client to connect to a specific Discord client. Here's how it works:\n1. Download Discord Canary. This is our most updated build, and is good to develop against: [Windows](https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=win) - [Mac](https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=osx)\n2. Download a second Discord Build. Here's our Public Test Build: [Windows](https://discord.com/api/download/ptb?platform=win) - [Mac](https://discord.com/api/download/ptb?platform=osx)\n3. Open up two Discord clients. We recommend you develop against Discord Canary, so you can use PTB or Stable for your test account\n4. Log in with two separate users. Make sure any test account is added to the application's App Whitelist in the portal!\nNow, in your game code, you can tell the SDK which client to connect to via the environment variable `DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID` **before initializing the SDK**. The value of the variable corresponds to the order in which you opened the clients, so `0` would connect to the first opened client, `1` the second, etc."

That is to say that if you have in-app purchases like gem bundles, skins, etc., they will be a `Consumable` SKU type.\nWhat that means is that your game is expected to \"consume\" these entitlements by doing something on your game server—giving the player a level, more coins, a skin, etc.—and then telling Discord that's been done by calling the `POST /entitlements/<id>/consume`, documented below. Then, Discord will mark that entitlement as `consumed` (the `consumed` field in the returned object will be set to `true`).\nEntitlements to consumable SKUs are intended to signal your game's server/service/database that the user should get something in-game, and that the entitlement should be invalidated afterwards.\nThe same consumable SKU _can_ be purchased multiple times, but we have some safeguards in place to protect against possible abuse. If you purchase a consumable SKU, you cannot purchase a second one until the first one has been consumed; in the context of normal IAP transactions, your game will be auto-consuming entitlements as soon as they're created. If some malicious folks are somehow able to generate entitlements to your SKUs, they will not be able to consume them without your token, so you'll be safe!\nNon-consumable SKUs can only be purchased once."

Validation, error states, and helpful UI walks them through your commands, meaning they can get it right the first time, especially on mobile. You now have one more ally in the fight against your phone's autocorrect.\nSlash Commands set your users up for success instead of confusion and frustration. They separate how users think and how your code works, meaning no matter how complex your codebase and commands may get, people who love your bot will find it approachable and easy to use.\nLet's get started!"

When receiving a [guild create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) payload, the API will only include active threads the current user can view.  Threads inside of private channels are completely private to the members of that private channel.  As such, when _gaining_ access to a channel the API sends a [thread list sync](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-list-sync), which includes all active threads in that channel.\nThreads also track membership.  Users must be added to a thread before sending messages in them.  The API will helpfully automatically add users to a thread when sending a message in that thread.\nGuilds have limits on the number of active threads and members per thread.  Once these are reached additional threads cannot be created or unarchived, and users cannot be added.  Threads do not count against the per-guild channel limit.\nThe [threads](#DOCS_TOPICS_THREADS) topic has some more information."

This allows bots to obtain real-time member data without requiring bots to store member state in memory.\n\\*\\*\\* The user objects in the mentions array will only have the partial `member` field present in [MESSAGE_CREATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) and [MESSAGE_UPDATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-update) events from text-based guild channels.\n\\*\\*\\*\\* Not all channel mentions in a message will appear in `mention_channels`. Only textual channels that are visible to everyone in a lurkable guild will ever be included. Only crossposted messages (via Channel Following) currently include `mention_channels` at all. If no mentions in the message meet these requirements, this field will not be sent.\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* This field is only returned for messages with a `type` of `19` (REPLY) or `21` (THREAD_STARTER_MESSAGE). If the message is a reply but the `referenced_message` field is not present, the backend did not attempt to fetch the message that was being replied to, so its state is unknown.

To do it most effectively, you should think about its purpose and how well (or not) it matches with your game and your implementation. Rich Presence is designed for these three things:\n1. Show interesting, unique, actionable data in a user’s profile\n2. Allow friends to spectate each other’s games\n3. Join a friend’s in-game party or server directly from Discord\nWe certainly don’t want to stifle creativity, especially for games that can use Rich Presence in an interesting way. However, keep in mind that this sort of gameplay is what it was designed for, and how players will normally interact with it.\nIf you want to do something creative, wacky, funky, or otherwise out-there with Rich Presence for your players and aren’t sure if you can, feel free to drop us a line at [gamedevs@discord.com](mailto:gamedevs@discord.com). We’re always happy to help!"

This will allow you to upload assets to your dashboard for later use.\nTo begin, you'll register your callback functions to the six `DiscordEventHandlers` and then call `Discord_Initialize()` with your `APPLICATION_ID`. If your game is distributed via Steam, you should also pass your application's Steam ID so Discord can launch your game through Steam:"

By registering your application protocols on installation and update, your players won't need to run the game before being able to interact with invites, Ask to Join, and spectating in Discord."

Developers do not need to do anything to handle this rate limit. The SDK will queue up any presence updates sent in that window and send the newest one once the client is free to do so.

You should iterate over these ports with your request until one returns a success response code or succeeds with a socket connection. Keep track of that port number for the rest of the session.\nTo keep your hardware in sync with Discord, send updates any time the hardware mute is toggled, or one of the voice features like echo cancellation is enabled or disabled by the user. This lets Discord get out of the way of your optimization when you're in control, or help out when you're not, ensuring an awesome experience for anyone using your hardware.\nEach time you update, send a full array of `devices`, sorted by your preferred priority. That means if you want a specific headset to be the default that Discord will attempt to use, put it first in the array."

To avoid excessive API calls, Discord expects clients to locally cache as many _relevant_ object states as possible, and to update them as gateway events are received.\nAn example of state tracking can be found with member status caching. When initially connecting to the gateway, the client receives information regarding the online status of guild members (online, idle, dnd, offline). To keep this state updated, a client must track and parse [Presence Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update) events as they are received, and apply the provided data to the cached member objects.\nFor larger bots, client state can grow to be quite large. We recommend only storing objects in memory that are needed for a bot's operation. Many bots, for example, just respond to user input through chat commands. These bots may only need to keep guild information (like guild/channel roles and permissions) in memory, since [MESSAGE_CREATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) and [MESSAGE_UPDATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-update) events have the full member object available."

Guild sharding is entirely user controlled, and requires no state-sharing between separate connections to operate.\nTo enable sharding on a connection, the user should send the `shard` array in the [Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify) payload. The first item in this array should be the zero-based integer value of the current shard, while the second represents the total number of shards. DMs will only be sent to shard 0. To calculate what events will be sent to what shard, the following formula can be used:"

As such, sessions do not have to be identified in an evenly distributed manner when sharding. You can establish multiple sessions with the same `[shard_id, num_shards]`, or sessions with different `num_shards` values. This allows you to create sessions that will handle more or less traffic than others for more fine-tuned load balancing, or orchestrate \"zero-downtime\" scaling/updating by handing off traffic to a new deployment of sessions with a higher or lower `num_shards` count that are prepared in parallel."

The gateway bot bootstrap endpoint will return the correct amount of shards, so if you're already using this endpoint to determine your number of shards, you shouldn't require any further changes.\nThe session start limit for these bots will also be increased from 1000 to `max(2000, (guild_count / 1000) * 3)` per day. You also receive an increased `max_concurrency`, the number of [shards you can concurrently start](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/session-start-limit-object).\nFinally, the [Get Current User Guilds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user-guilds) endpoint will no longer return results for your bot.

When initially connecting, if you don't have the `GUILD_PRESENCES` [Gateway Intent](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents), or if the guild is over 75k members, it will only send members who are in voice, plus the member for you (the connecting user). Otherwise, if a guild has over `large_threshold` members (value in the [Gateway Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify)), it will only send members who are online, have a role, have a nickname, or are in a voice channel, and if it has under `large_threshold` members, it will send all members. If a client wishes to receive additional members, they need to explicitly request them via this operation. The server will send [Guild Members Chunk](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-members-chunk) events in response with up to 1000 members per chunk until all members that match the request have been sent.\nDue to our privacy and infrastructural concerns with this feature, there are some limitations that apply:\n- `GUILD_PRESENCES` intent is required to set `presences = true`. Otherwise, it will always be false\n- `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent is required to request the entire member list—`(query=‘’, limit=0<=n)`\n- You will be limited to requesting 1 `guild_id` per request\n- Requesting a prefix (`query` parameter) will return a maximum of 100 members\n- Requesting `user_ids` will continue to be limited to returning 100 members"

[Cross Site Request Forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery), or CSRF, and [Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking) are security vulnerabilities that must be addressed by individuals implementing OAuth. This is typically accomplished using the `state` parameter. `state` is sent in the authorization request and returned back in the response and should be a value that binds the user's request to their authenticated state. For example, `state` could be a hash of the user's session cookie, or some other nonce that can be linked to the user's session.\nWhen a user begins an authorization flow on the client, a `state` is generated that is unique to that user's request. This value is stored somewhere only accessible to the client and the user, i.e. protected by the [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy). When the user is redirected, the `state` parameter is returned. The client validates the request by checking that the `state` returned matches the stored value. If they match, it is a valid authorization request. If they do not match, it's possible that someone intercepted the request or otherwise falsely authorized themselves to another user's resources, and the request should be denied.\nWhile Discord does not require the use of the `state` parameter, we support it and highly recommend that you implement it for the security of your own applications and data."

Automating normal user accounts (generally called \"self-bots\") outside of the OAuth2/bot API is forbidden, and can result in an account termination if found.\nBot accounts have a few differences in comparison to normal user accounts, namely:\n1. Bots are added to guilds through the OAuth2 API, and cannot accept normal invites.\n2. Bots cannot have friends, nor be added to or join Group DMs.\n3. Bots do not have a maximum number of Guilds (unlike user accounts, which are limited to 100).\n4. Bots have an entirely separate set of [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits)."

                "text": "Permissions in Discord are a way to limit and grant certain abilities to users. A set of base permissions can be configured at the guild level for different roles. When these roles are attached to users, they grant or revoke specific privileges within the guild. Along with the guild-level permissions, Discord also supports permission overwrites that can be assigned to individual guild roles or guild members on a per-channel basis.\nPermissions are stored within a variable-length integer serialized into a string, and are calculated using bitwise operations. For example, the permission value `123` will be serialized as `\"123\"`. For long-term stability, we recommend deserializing the permissions using your languages' Big Integer libraries. The total permissions integer can be determined by ORing together each individual value, and flags can be checked using AND operations.\nIn API v8, all permissions—including `allow` and `deny` fields in overwrites—are serialized as strings. There are also no longer `_new` permission fields; all new permissions are rolled back into the base field.\nIn API v6, the `permissions`, `allow`, and `deny` fields in roles and overwrites are still serialized as a number; however, these numbers shall not grow beyond 31 bits. During the remaining lifetime of API v6, all new permission bits will only be introduced in `permissions_new`, `allow_new`, and `deny_new`. These `_new` fields are just for response serialization; requests with these fields should continue to use the original `permissions`, `allow`, and `deny` fields, which accept both string or number values."

A bot's or user's highest role is its role that has the greatest position value in the guild, with the default @everyone role starting at 0. Permissions follow a hierarchy with the following rules:\n- A bot can grant roles to other users that are of a lower position than its own highest role.\n- A bot can edit roles of a lower position than its highest role, but it can only grant permissions it has to those roles.\n- A bot can only sort roles lower than its highest role.\n- A bot can only kick, ban, and edit nicknames for users whose highest role is lower than the bot's highest role.\nOtherwise, permissions do not obey the role hierarchy. For example, a user has two roles: A and B. A denies the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission on a #coolstuff channel. B allows the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission on the same #coolstuff channel. The user would ultimately be able to view the #coolstuff channel, regardless of the role positions."

With this in mind, permissions are applied to users in the following hierarchy:\n1. Base permissions given to @everyone are applied at a guild level\n2. Permissions allowed to a user by their roles are applied at a guild level\n3. Overwrites that deny permissions for @everyone are applied at a channel level\n4.

Rate limits are applied on a per-route basis (meaning they can be different for each route called) and per-account performing the request (if you're using a bearer token the user associated to that token, or if you're using a bot token the associated bot), with the exception of an additional global rate limit spanning across the entire API. Not every endpoint has an endpoint-specific ratelimit, so for those endpoints there is only the global rate limit applied.\nBy \"per-route,\" we mean that unique rate limits exist for the path you are accessing on our API, sometimes including the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and including major parameters. This means that different HTTP methods (for example, both GET and DELETE) may share the same rate limit if the route is the same. Additionally, rate limits take into account major parameters in the URL. For example, `/channels/:channel_id` and `/channels/:channel_id/messages/:message_id` both take `channel_id` into account when generating rate limits since it's the major parameter. Currently, the only major parameters are `channel_id`, `guild_id`, and `webhook_id + webhook_token`.\n\"Per-route\" rate limits _may_ be shared across multiple, similar-use routes (or even the same route with a different HTTP method). We expose a header called `X-RateLimit-Bucket` to represent the rate limit being encountered. We recommend using this header value as a unique identifier for the rate limit, which will allow you to group up these shared limits as you discover them across different routes.\nBecause we may change rate limits at any time and rate limits can be different per application, _rate limits should not be hard coded into your bot/application_. In order to properly support our dynamic rate limits, your bot/application should parse for our rate limits in response headers and locally prevent exceeding the limits as they change."

When you create an app on our Developers site, you must specify an \"RPC Origin\" and \"Redirect URI\" from which to permit connections and authorizations. **The origin you send when connecting and the redirect uri you send when exchanging an authorization code for an access token must match one of the ones entered on the Developers site.**\nWhen establishing a WebSocket connection, we verify the Origin header on connection to prevent client ID spoofing. You will be instantly disconnected if the Origin does not match.\nIf you're connecting to the RPC server from within a browser, RPC origins are usually in the form `SCHEME://HOST[:PORT]`, where `SCHEME` is typically https or http, `HOST` is your domain or ip, and `PORT` is the port of the webserver from which the user will be connecting (omitted for ports 80 and 443). For example, `https://discord.com` would be used if the user were connecting from `https://discord.com/some/page/url`.\nIf you're connecting to the RPC server from within a non-browser application (like a game), you just need to make sure that the origin is sent with the upgrade request when connecting to the WebSocket. For local testing, we recommend testing with an origin like `https://localhost`. For production apps, we recommend setting the origin to your company/game's domain, for example `https://discord.com`."

We grant 50 testing spots, which should be ample for development. After approval, this restriction is removed and your app will be accessible to anyone.\nWe also have an RPC token system to bypass the user authorization modal. This is usable by approved games as well as by users on a game's list of testers, and also disallows use of the `messages.read` scope. If you have been granted access, you can send a POST request to `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token/rpc` with your application's `client_id` and `client_secret` in the body (sent as a url-encoded body, **not JSON**). You can then pass the returned `rpc_token` value to the `rpc_token` field in your RPC authorize request (documented below)."

Since the number of archived threads can be quite large, keeping all of them in memory may be quite prohibitive. Therefore guilds are capped at a certain number of active threads, and only active threads can be manipulated. Users cannot edit messages, add reactions, use slash commands, or join archived threads. The only operation that should happen within an archived thread is messages being deleted. Sending a message will automatically unarchive the thread, unless the thread has been locked by a moderator.\nBecause of this constraint, the gateway protocol is designed to ensure that bots are able to have an accurate view of the full set of active threads, but archived threads are not synced up-front via the gateway.\nThreads do not count against the max-channels limit in a guild, but there will be a new limit on the maximum number of active threads in a guild."

Usually the event wil be [Guild Role Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-role-update), [Guild Member Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-members-update) or [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-update). It will be some event that caused the permissions on a channel to change. So _if_ a bot wanted to simulate a \"lost access to thread\" event, it is entirely possible, albeit quite complicated to handle all cases correctly. Under the hood, Discord's clients actually don't worry about this detail. Instead, when performing an action, the client checks permissions first (which implicitly checks if the client has access to the parent channel too, since threads inherit permissions), that way _even if_ the client has some stale data, it does not end up acting on it.\nAdditionally, when a client loses access to a channel they are not removed from the thread. Users may want to temporarily shut down access to a server or channel. Removing someone from all threads when that happens would not be a good experience, so we've chosen not to go that route. Users will still be reported as members of a thread, even if they no longer have access to the parent channel. They will **not** receive new gateway events for those threads though, with one exception: If a client is removed from a thread _after_ losing access to the parent channel, they will still receive a [Thread Members Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-members-update) dispatch."
